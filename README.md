# Fragment Navigation

This is a simple demonstration of Fragment Navigation using Jetpack Navigation.

This follows the "Single Activity" principle while still using the traditional XML way of laying out a GUI.

Compare this to [Navigation With Jetpack Compose](https://github.com/erickveil/JetpackNavigation). I've found it much faster to write out the UI in Jetpack Compose and define the navigation that way, but there are still a lot of projects out there that do things this way.
